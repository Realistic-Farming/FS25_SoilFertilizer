> *"Applied liquid fertilizer three seasons straight because the yield looked fine. Then I checked and saw pH was sitting at 5.4. The nutrients I'd been pouring in couldn't even be absorbed. One application of lime later and the next harvest told the whole story."*

<br>

**In base FS25, every field is born equal and stays that way forever. This mod remembers.**

Each field builds its own history. Nitrogen drops after a heavy wheat crop. Rain washes potassium out of sandy ground. Fallow fields slowly breathe back to life. The numbers you see in the HUD aren't arbitrary, they're the consequence of every harvest, every storm, and every bag of fertilizer you did or didn't apply.

## ✨ Features

### 🧪 Per-Field Soil Chemistry

Five values tracked independently for every field on the map:

| | Nutrient | Role | Depleted By |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 | **Nitrogen (N)** | Growth and leaf mass | Harvest, rain leaching, fall season |
| 🔵 | **Phosphorus (P)** | Root development and energy | Harvest |
| 🟡 | **Potassium (K)** | Water regulation and yield quality | Harvest, rain leaching |
| 🟤 | **Organic Matter (OM)** | Soil structure and nutrient buffering | Builds slowly via manure and plowing |
| ⚗️ | **pH** | Unlocks nutrient availability | Rain acidification - raised by lime and plowing |

All five values persist in your save. A field that's been growing canola for three seasons without lime will feel different from one you've been managing carefully.

### 🌾 Crop-Specific Extraction

Different crops take different amounts from your soil. Push the same field too hard and it shows.

| Crop | N drain | P drain | K drain | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🥔 Potato | ●●●●● | ●●●● | ●●●●● | Extreme K demand - must rotate |
| 🟣 Sugar Beet | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●● | Heaviest K of any crop |
| 🌻 Sunflower | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Moderate-high all round |
| 🌼 Canola | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | High N demand, oilseed crop |
| 🫘 Soybean | ●●●●● | ●●●○○ | ●●●○○ | Highest N - partial fixation assumed |
| 🌽 Maize | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Large biomass, needs N and K |
| 🌾 Wheat | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ | Moderate - manageable with rotation |
| 🌾 Barley / Oats / Rye | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ●●●○○ | Light feeders, good rotation crops |
| 🫛 Peas / Beans | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | Legumes - still need balanced soil |

### 🔄 Crop Rotation

The mod tracks the last **3 harvested crops** per field and actively rewards good rotation practice and penalises lazy mono-cropping.

| Situation | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Legume → Non-legume** (soybean, peas, or beans last season) | +0.5 N/day for the first 3 days of spring nitrogen fixation carry-over |
| **Same crop two seasons running** | ×1.15 extraction multiplier on that harvest, 15% extra depletion across N, P, and K |
| **Healthy alternation** | No modifier in either direction |

The Soil Report now shows your rotation status per field alongside the nutrient recommendations: *Rotation Bonus*, *Fatigue: Same Crop*, or *Rotation: OK*. History is saved with your savegame and synced in multiplayer. Can be toggled off in settings.

### 🐛 Field Health System

Three pressure scores (0–100) track threats to each field independently. Left unchecked they reduce your actual harvest yield fewer liters in the combine hopper, less money at the sell point. Treat them with the right product and the pressure drops within a few days.

| Pressure | Source | Treatment | Resets naturally | Max penalty |
|----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 🌿 **Weed** | Grows daily - peaks without tillage | `HERBICIDE` spray | Any tillage / plowing | −30% |
| 🐞 **Pest** | Insects - peaks in summer | `INSECTICIDE` spray | Harvest disperses population | −30% |
| 🍄 **Disease** | Fungal - driven by rain | `FUNGICIDE` spray | 3+ dry days cause natural decay | −25% |

All three are visible in the HUD and the full Soil Report. Each can be toggled off in settings.

**Named diseases and fungicide chemistry** - disease pressure isn't just a number. Each crop can catch specific real-world diseases (wheat gets septoria, rust, and fusarium head blight; potatoes get late and early blight; soybeans get frogeye and white mould, and so on - around 40 in total). Press **Scout** (`SF_SCOUT`, default **Shift+K**) on a field to identify the active disease, then choose from a catalog of **23 fungicides** across seven chemistry families (triazoles, strobilurins, SDHIs, contact protectants, specialty, preventatives, and seed treatments). Each product has its own cost, per-disease effectiveness, and application window, and works best applied early, on-window, and not in the rain. Rotate chemistry families to keep them working.

**Treatment panel** - press **Open Soil Treatment Panel** (`SF_TREATMENT`, default **Shift+T**) for a per-field prescription: exactly which nutrients, lime, and protection products a field needs right now.

### 💊 Fertilizer Types

|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Compost** | Spreader | Low | Low | Low | ●●●●● | Best OM builder per litre |
| **Biosolids** | Spreader | ●●○○○ | ●●○○○ | Low | ✓ | Municipal organic amendment |
| **Chicken Manure** | Spreader | ●●●○○ | ●●●○○ | ●●○○○ | ✓ | Concentrated poultry litter |
| **Pelletized Manure** | Spreader | ●●●●○ | ●●●○○ | ●●●●○ | ✓ | Dense balanced organic NPK |
| **Gypsum** | Spreader | - | - | - | Low | Lowers pH, minor OM gain |
| **Liquid Lime** | Sprayer | - | - | - | - | Raises pH via sprayer equipment |

> [!NOTE]
> Organic matter builds slowly - it takes many seasons to accumulate meaningfully. Soil with high OM buffers pH swings and slows nutrient loss from rain.

### 🚜 Soil Compaction

Heavy vehicles compact the soil they drive over. Compaction is tracked per field (0–100%) and
gradually reduces how effectively the field can absorb nutrients.

| Threshold | Vehicle weight | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **Compaction hit** | ≥ 8 t total (tractor + implement) | +2% compaction per day (once per game day) |
| **Subsoiler pass** | Any cultivator with `isSubsoiler = true` | −15% compaction per pass |
| **Natural decay** | Automatically | −0.5% per game day |

Compaction bites in two ways. It reduces yield directly (up to **15%** at 100% compaction, so a
compacted field yields less even when N/P/K are fully topped up), and it also makes the crop pull
harder on the soil, adding up to **20%** extra nutrient depletion at harvest.

The HUD shows compaction as a colour-coded row (green < 20%, amber 20–60%, red > 60%). It also
appears as **overlay layer 10** on the in-game map. Compaction is saved to `soilData.xml` and
synced to all clients in multiplayer. Toggle it in settings if you prefer to skip this mechanic.

### 📊 Coverage Tracking

The sprayer now tracks which individual soil cells have been covered in an application pass.
Coverage fraction is shown live in the HUD as `Coverage: X% / 70% min`. The fully-treated
field notification is gated on achieving **70% minimum coverage** - a single-pass clip across
a field corner no longer triggers a false "field treated" popup.

### 🌦️ Environmental Effects

The mod isn't just about what you put in - it's about what the world takes out.

| Effect | What happens |
|---|---|
| 🌧️ **Rain leaching** | Nitrogen and potassium wash out during heavy rain. Phosphorus binds tightly and barely moves. |
| 🍂 **Fall nitrogen loss** | Biological activity slows in autumn, pulling N levels down naturally. |
| 🌱 **Spring nitrogen boost** | Microbial activity picks back up in spring, recovering a small amount of N. |
| 🌧️ **pH acidification** | Rain is slightly acidic. Ignore liming long enough and your soil will show it. |
| 🌾 **Fallow recovery** | Fields left unplanted for 7+ days slowly recover nutrients on their own. |
| 🚜 **Plowing bonus** | Aerates soil, nudging pH toward neutral and boosting organic matter mixing. |
| 🌿 **Residue incorporation** | Working post-harvest stubble back into the soil releases a small NPK and OM pulse from decomposing straw. Deeper tillage releases more; direct-drills release the least. |

### 🤖 Smart Precision Systems

Three in-vehicle overlay panels that appear when you enter a supported sprayer. Each appears as a collapsible HUD panel that can be independently repositioned in Free Panel Layout mode.

| System | What it does | How to enable |
|---|---|---|
| **Smart Sensor** | Monitors pest, disease, and nutrient need per section. Blocks spraying on sections with no active need detected. | Settings → Admin → Smart Systems. Works with any VWW sprayer. |
| **See & Spray** | Shows live per-cell pressure for pest, disease, and weed at the sprayer's current position. Colour-coded per section. | Purchase a **JD R700i** or **JD R975i** with the *See & Spray* shop configuration selected. |
| **Variable Rate** | Adjusts boom output rate per section based on soil deficits for the loaded product. Green bar = low rate; red bar = high rate. | Default key **Alt+7** (rebind `SF_VARIABLE_RATE` in **Controls → Mods**). Enable in Admin → Smart Systems. |

Smart Sensor and Variable Rate work with any VWW-capable sprayer. **See & Spray requires the JD R700i (28 m) or JD R975i (36 m)** with the See & Spray option selected at purchase - base game sprayers are not tested with this feature.

**Free Panel Layout** - Enable in Settings → Display → Position, then use the Shift+H edit mode to drag each panel independently. Press **[−]** in any panel's title bar to collapse it to the title bar only. Positions and collapse states are saved to `hud.xml`.

### 📊 Soil HUD

A compact overlay shows the current field's soil status while you're working. Colour-coded indicators make problems visible at a glance:

🟢 **Green** - healthy, no action needed &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🟡 **Amber** - getting low, plan ahead &nbsp;|&nbsp; 🔴 **Red** - depleted, yield is being reduced

The **yield forecast row** (e.g. `Yield ~-18%`) is not just a warning - it reflects what the combine will actually collect. N/P/K deficits, weed, pest, and disease pressure all reduce real harvest liters. The HUD percentage is exactly the hit your tank takes.

Additional rows appear contextually: **Coverage** (`Coverage: X% / 70% min`) while a sprayer is active on a field, and **Compaction** (when soil compaction is above 0% and the setting is enabled). Both are colour-coded with the same green/amber/red tiers as nutrients.

Fully customisable: 6 positions, 4 colour themes, 5 transparency levels, 3 font sizes, and a compact mode that shrinks to one line per nutrient. The HUD drag mode (`SF_HUD_DRAG`, default **Shift+H**) lets you reposition panels in Free Panel Layout and is rebindable through the standard FS25 key bindings menu.

### 📋 Full Farm Soil Report

The **Farm Overview** tab in the Soil PDA page shows all your fields sorted by urgency - the fields that need the most attention appear at the top. Each row shows N/P/K, pH, OM, weed and pest pressure, and an overall status badge. Click any row to open a field detail popup with a complete breakdown, yield forecast, and specific treatment recommendations.

### 📱 Soil PDA Page

Open the FS25 in-game menu (**ESC**) and select the **Soil & Fertilizer** tab in the tab bar to reach the dedicated soil page. Accessible any time - on foot, in a vehicle, or while paused.

**Left sidebar** - live farm-wide snapshot updated each time the page opens:
- Fields tracked and fields owned
- Average N, P, K, pH, and Organic Matter across all your fields
- Weed, Pest, and Disease pressure field counts
- Fields currently below fertilizer threshold

**Two tabs:**

| Tab | What you see |
|---|---|
| **Farm Overview** | Full list of every tracked field - N%, P%, K%, pH, OM, and an overall status badge. Click any row to open a per-field detail popup |
| **Treatment Plan** | Fields sorted by urgency (worst first) with the primary deficiency or pressure identified. Minor-urgency fields grouped at the bottom |

The interactive **Soil Map overlay** lives in the native PDA Map (ESC → Map). Use the sidebar to select and cycle overlay layers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, pH, OM, Weed, Pest, Disease) without leaving the game map.

**Field Detail popup** (click any row in Farm Overview or Treatment Plan):
- All five nutrient values with colour-coded Good / Fair / Poor status
- Weed, Pest, and Disease pressure - asterisk (`*`) shown when a protection product is active
- Last harvested crop and crop rotation status (Legume Bonus / Fatigue / OK)

## ⚙️ Settings

Settings are split across two places.

### ESC → Settings → Game Settings → Soil & Fertilizer

Three core settings live here so you can reach them quickly:

| Setting | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Enable mod** | On / Off | Stops all simulation when off |
| **Notifications** | On / Off | Pop-up alerts when fields get critically low |
| **Debug mode** | On / Off | Verbose logging to the game log |

### Full Settings Panel

The full panel ships with its key **unbound** to avoid clashing with other mods. Bind **Open Soil Settings** (`SF_OPEN_SETTINGS`) once in **Options → Controls → Mods** - the mod's suggested key is **Shift+O** - then press it anywhere in-game (on foot or in a vehicle) to open the panel. Settings are organised into three categories. The panel also includes an **Admin** button (previously labelled *Drain Vehicle*) - pressing it opens a dedicated admin page with all console commands listed and executable as buttons directly in-game:

**🌱 Simulation** - controls the core simulation behaviour

| Setting | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Fertility system** | On / Off | Toggles the entire nutrient and pH simulation |
| **Nutrient cycles** | On / Off | Enables crop depletion and natural recovery |
| **Fertilizer costs** | On / Off | Adds running costs to fertilizer application |
| **Seasonal effects** | On / Off | Spring nitrogen boost and fall nitrogen loss |
| **Rain effects** | On / Off | Leaching and pH acidification from rain |
| **Plowing bonus** | On / Off | Whether plowing improves OM and pH |
| **Residue incorporation** | On / Off | Whether tillage tools release nutrients from worked-in straw residue |
| **Weed pressure** | On / Off | Track weed competition per field |
| **Pest pressure** | On / Off | Track insect pest populations per field |
| **Disease pressure** | On / Off | Track crop disease per field |
| **Disease climate** | Arid / Temperate / Humid / Wet | How wet the map's climate runs. Wetter climates push disease harder and shorten fungicide protection |
| **Disease difficulty** | Easy / Normal / Hard | How aggressive named crop diseases are |
| **Crop rotation** | On / Off | Enable legume bonus and mono-crop fatigue multiplier |
| **Soil compaction** | On / Off | Heavy vehicles (≥ 8 t) compact soil, reducing nutrient availability |
| **Imperial units** | On / Off | Sprayer rates in gal/ac and lb/ac instead of L/ha and kg/ha |
| **Difficulty** | Simple / Realistic / Hardcore | Scales depletion rate - 0.7× / 1× / 1.5× |
| **Replenishment rate** | Very Slow (0.25×) → Very Fast (2.0×) | Global multiplier on how fast fertilizer restores nutrients |

**🖥️ Display / HUD** - controls what you see on screen

| Setting | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **HUD enabled** | On / Off | Show or hide the soil overlay |
| **HUD position** | 6 options | Top-right, top-left, bottom-right, bottom-left, centre-right, or custom |
| **HUD colour theme** | 4 themes | Green / Blue / Amber / Mono |
| **HUD transparency** | Clear → Solid | 5 opacity levels |

| **Colourblind mode** | On / Off | Swaps the status palette for colourblind-friendly colours |
| **Free Panel Layout** | On / Off | Drag each in-vehicle panel to its own position (Shift+H edit mode) |

**🗺️ Map** - controls the PDA map overlay

| Setting | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Active map layer** | Off / N / P / K / pH / OM / Urgency / Weed / Pest / Disease / Compaction / Yield | Data layer shown on the PDA map (11 layers, cycled with `SF_CYCLE_MAP_LAYER` or the overlay sidebar) |
| **Overlay density** | Low / Medium / High | Number of data points rendered on the map overlay - Low (8k), Medium (20k), High (40k). Reduce if the map causes frame drops |

**🛠️ Admin → Smart Systems** - precision-farming toggles (admin only in multiplayer)

| Setting | Options | What it does |
|---|---|---|

| **Field boundary control** | On / Off | Shut boom sections off past the field edge |
| **Overlap prevention** | On / Off | Shut sections off over already-treated ground |

**⚗️ Advanced Tuning** - opened from the Admin page, for players who want to hand-tune the model

Every core rate has its own multiplier: nutrient depletion, fertilizer efficiency, rain leaching, seasonal strength, pest growth, disease growth, fallow recovery, and compaction build-up / decay. You can also set the starting N / P / K / pH / OM that every new field rolls with. Defaults reproduce the standard simulation - move a value only if you want that part of the model faster, slower, or stronger.

> [!NOTE]
> In multiplayer, settings are **server-authoritative** - the host's settings are pushed to all clients on join. Non-admin clients can see but not change server settings. HUD display preferences are always local and can be changed by any player.

## 🔌 Mod Integrations

All integrations are detected automatically at runtime and fail gracefully if the mod isn't installed.

| Mod | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| **FS25_precisionFarming** | **Incompatible.** When Precision Farming is detected as active, this mod automatically disables itself at startup to prevent data corruption. Disable PF in the mod manager to use this mod instead. |
| **FS25_SeasonalCropStress** | Soil pH and organic matter influence evapotranspiration rates per field. |
| **FS25_NPCFavor** | NPC neighbour favour quests can reference your fields' soil state. |
| **FS25_MoistureSystem** | Compatible - both mods use independent hooks. No conflicts. |

---

## 🛠️ Installation

**1. Download** `FS25_SoilFertilizer.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Realistic-Farming/FS25_SoilFertilizer/releases/latest).

**2. Copy** the ZIP (do not extract) to your mods folder:

| Platform | Path |
|---|---|
| 🪟 Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\My Games\FarmingSimulator2025\mods\` |
| 🍎 macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/FarmingSimulator2025/mods/` |

**3. Enable** *Realistic Soil & Fertilizer* in the in-game mod manager.

**4. Load** any career save - soil data initialises automatically on first load.

---

## 🎮 Quick Start

```
1. Load your farm - the soil HUD appears in the top-right corner
2. Drive to any field - nutrient values update as you move
3. Amber or red values → that field needs fertilizer or lime
4. Apply lime first - it unlocks the full value of everything else
5. Apply fertilizer → watch N/P/K climb in real time
6. Open the tablet → Soil & Fertilizer → Farm Overview to see all fields by urgency
7. Press Shift+O → open the full settings panel to tune the simulation
8. Let a field go fallow for a season → it slowly recovers on its own
9. At harvest → healthy soil means the full yield you worked for
```

> [!TIP]
> Fields start slightly acidic and with moderate nutrients - matching the base game's starting state. Lime first, then fertilize. Nutrients in acidic soil have reduced availability no matter how much product you apply.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

| Issue | Details |
|---|---|
| 🌱 **Base game lime indicator** | The base game's "needs liming" flag is a separate system from our pH tracking. Both update when you apply lime through the sprayer, but the indicators can show different states until the field is treated. Workaround: disable the base game's liming requirement in **Settings → Farming → Liming** to rely solely on our HUD. |
| 🌐 **Multiplayer** | Soil simulation runs on the server only. Clients receive synced state on join and after each harvest or fertiliser event. |
| ⚠️ **Section Control** | When outer boom sections are shut off at field boundaries, nutrient credit scales to the active fraction. Sections manually blocked by a Section Control mod may not be detected - credit is based on the sprayer's reported active sections, not physical coverage. |
